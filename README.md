# Google Play Store Apps Analysis
# Introduction
The Google Play Store is one of the most popular Android app stores. The data set used in this report consists of some of the apps that are found in this store. The data set is officially called Google Play Store Apps and can be found on Kaggle. It was originally webscraped by a user Lavanya Gupta; a Computer Science graduate at Carnegie Mellon University. Researchers in the past have used Google Play Store Apps dataset to do exploratory data analysis, machine learning tasks and more. However, before building any models, there are three crucial initial steps that should be performed. Those are cleaning data, visualizing data and doing dimension reduction on the data. In this project, we complete the three steps mentioned in order to have a better understanding of the data.  
# Summary Information
 The data set has 10841 instances and 13 variables, but only 10 of the 13 are used in this report.
